EXPLOSION EFFECT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

METHOD 1 - SIMPLE PARTICLE EXPLOSION:
1. Create Empty GameObject → Name it "ExplosionPrefab"
2. Add ParticleSystem component to it
3. Add the SimpleExplosion script to it
4. Drag it to your Prefabs folder to make it a prefab
5. In each Cube prefab, drag the ExplosionPrefab to the "Explosion Prefab" field

METHOD 2 - CUSTOM PARTICLE EXPLOSION:
1. Create Empty GameObject → Add ParticleSystem
2. Configure Particle System:
   - Main → Start Lifetime: 1
   - Main → Start Speed: 3-8
   - Main → Start Size: 0.05-0.2
   - Main → Start Color: Yellow/Orange/Red
   - Main → Max Particles: 30-100
   
   - Emission → Rate over Time: 0
   - Emission → Bursts: Add burst at time 0 with 50 particles
   
   - Shape → Shape: Sphere, Radius: 0.1
   
   - Velocity over Lifetime → Enable, Radial: 2-5
   
   - Color over Lifetime → Enable, fade from bright to transparent
   
   - Size over Lifetime → Enable, start small, grow, then shrink

3. Save as prefab and assign to cubes

METHOD 3 - NO PARTICLE SYSTEM (SIMPLE ANIMATION):
- The code already includes a scale-up animation effect
- The cube will grow 2x bigger then disappear
- No need to assign explosion prefab - just leave it empty

WHAT THE EXPLOSION DOES:
✅ Cube stops moving during explosion
✅ Cube scales up (grows bigger)
✅ Particle explosion plays (if prefab assigned)
✅ Cube becomes invisible
✅ Explosion continues for full duration
✅ Cube gets destroyed

WRONG CLICK EFFECT:
✅ Cube flashes red 3 times when wrong cube is clicked
✅ No movement interruption for wrong clicks

CUSTOMIZATION:
- explosionDuration: How long the explosion lasts
- explosionPrefab: Particle system for explosion effect
